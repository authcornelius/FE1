            <h2>Svelte: The Compiler Framework</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Svelte, created by Rich Harris, is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Unlike traditional frameworks that do the bulk of their work in the browser (like React or Vue.js), Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.</p>
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>No Virtual DOM</li>
                <li>Reactive Assignments</li>
                <li>Minimal Runtime</li>
                <li>Component-Based</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Performance</li>
                <li>Bundle Size</li>
                <li>Simplicity</li>

            <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ecosystem</li>

            <h2>Vue.js: The Progressive Framework</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Vue.js, developed by Evan You, is a progressive JavaScript framework used to build user interfaces. Unlike Svelte, Vue.js embraces a more traditional approach with a virtual DOM and a reactive component system.</p>
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Virtual DOM</li>
                <li>Reactivity System</li>
                <li>Component-Based Architecture</li>
                <li>Ecosystem</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Flexibility</li>
                <li>Ecosystem and Tooling</li>
                <li>Community and Resources</li>
